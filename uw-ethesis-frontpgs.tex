\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}

In the task of estimating risk measures for portfolios of complex financial derivatives, nested simulation procedures are commonly required but often computationally expensive. 
Tremendous efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of nested simulation procedures by approximating the inner simulation model with a proxy model. 
In this study, we review the literature on nested simulation procedures in financial engineering and establish fair comparisons of different proxy models using the same set of numerical examples. 
Our study shows interesting findings on the performance of different proxy models and provides useful insights for practitioners to choose proxy models for nested simulation procedures.
