Quantitative risk management is a key component of modern financial systems, ensuring the stability and resilience of markets, institutions, and portfolios against an array of risks. 
For complex financial products, such as option portfolios and variable annuity contracts, traditional risk assessment methods often fall short in accurately capturing the multifaceted nature of market, credit, and operational risks. 
This is where advanced Monte Carlo simulation techniques, particularly nested simulation procedures, become indispensable.
In constract to finite-difference methods, a Monte Carlo simulation scheme is more flexible and can be easily adapted to model complex financial products with multiple sources of risk.
