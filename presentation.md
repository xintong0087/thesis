# Resilient Machine Learning Approaches for Fast Risk Evaluation and Management in Financial Portfolios and Variable Annuities

---

## Project 1: Nested Simulation Procedures in Financial Engineering

---

### Introduction

- Nested simulation procedures are used to estimate risk measures for complex financial derivatives portfolios
$$\rho(L) = \rho(L(X)), \;\;\; L(X) = \mathbb{E}\left[ Y|X=x \right]\vert_{x=X}  $$
- Involves two levels of Monte Carlo simulations:
  - Outer level: generates underlying risk factors (outer scenarios), $X_i \sim F_X$
  - Inner level: generates scenario-wise samples of portfolio losses (inner replications), $Y_{ij} \sim F_{Y|X_i}$
- Computationally expensive due to nested structure

---

### Standard Nested Simulation

$$\hat{L}_{N, i} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N Y_{ij}; ~~~ Y_{ij} \sim F_{Y|X_i} $$

- Proposed by Gordy and Juneja (2010)
- Uses standard MC estimator (sample mean of inner replications)
- Optimal budget allocation between outer scenarios and inner replications
- Computationally expensive and potentially wasteful

---

### Improved Nested Simulation Procedures

1. Regression-based (Broadie et al., 2015)
2. Kernel smoothing (Hong et al., 2017)
3. Likelihood ratio (Feng et al., 2020)
4. Kernel ridge regression (Zhang et al., 2022)
5. Multi-level Monte Carlo (Giles, 2019)

Key idea: Pool inner replications from different outer scenarios

---

### Metamodeling Approach

- Use supervised learning models to approximate the inner simulation model
- Treat inner simulation as a black-box function
- Approximate $L(\cdot)$ with $\hat{L}^{\text{SL}}_{M, N}(\cdot)$
- Use trained model to make predictions for all $X \in \mathcal{X}$

---

### Problem Statement

Minimize MSE of the estimator subject to total simulation budget:

$$
\min_{M, N} \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( \hat{\rho}_{M, N} - \rho \right)^2 \right]
$$

Subject to: $M \cdot N = \Gamma$

Interested in convergence order as $\Gamma \to \infty$

---

### Key Theoretical Results: 

- Most literature focuses on Mean Squared Error (MSE) of estimator $\hat{\rho}$
- Wang et al. (2022) analyze convergence in terms of absolute error and claim to bridge gap between cubic and square root convergence rates

### Definitions

1. Convergence in MSE:
   $\mathbb{E} \left[ \left(\hat{\rho}_{\Gamma} - \rho\right)^2 \right] = \mathcal{O} \left( \Gamma^{-\xi} \right)$

2. Convergence in Probabilistic Order:
   $|\hat{\rho}_{\Gamma} - \rho| = \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}}(\Gamma^{-\xi})$

---

### Key Theorem

**Theorem 1:** If $\hat{\rho}_{\Gamma}$ converges in MSE to $\rho$ in order $\xi$, then $\hat{\rho}_{\Gamma}$ converges in probabilistic order to $\rho$ in order $\frac{\xi}{2}$.

### Implications of Theorem 1

- First result showing connection between MSE and probabilistic order convergence
- Applicable to any nested simulation procedure converging in MSE
- Convergence in MSE implies convergence in probabilistic order

---

### Converse Not Necessarily True

- Convergence in probabilistic order doesn't always imply convergence in MSE
- Probabilistic order convergence is weaker than MSE convergence

### Analysis of Wang et al. (2022)

- Their results show convergence in probabilistic order for absolute error
- Not necessarily equivalent to convergence in MSE
- Bridges the gap, but only in terms of probabilistic order for absolute error


---

### Numerical Experiments

- Compared 6 nested simulation procedures
- Various risk measures: quadratic tracking error, mean excess loss, probability of large loss, VaR, CVaR
- Different portfolios: European calls, geometric Asian options, barrier options
- Asset dimensions: $d = 1, 2, 5, 10, 20$
- $525$ experimental settings, $1000$ macro repetitions each
