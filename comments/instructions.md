When you revise your draft, please
1. highlight those subject to change and/or addition in red font on the
revised copy.
2. create a separate list of responses to detail which response applies to
which question and on which page (of bold the old and new copies).
3. Mention in the list of responses those removed from the revised
draft (cut and paste the paragraph removed from the draft to the list of responses)
and mention the page(s) on both the old and new copies.
